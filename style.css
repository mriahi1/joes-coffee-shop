To create a minimalist `style.css` file using Tailwind CSS that meets the specified features, you'll first need to ensure that Tailwind CSS is properly set up in your project. Since Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework, most styling is applied directly in the HTML via class attributes. Below, we'll detail how to use Tailwind's classes to achieve the desired features directly in your HTML, as the actual CSS file is usually just the compiled version of Tailwind without specific customizations.

### Setting Up Tailwind CSS
1. Install Tailwind CSS into your project:
   ```bash
   npm install tailwindcss
   ```

2. Generate the `tailwind.config.js` and initial CSS files:
   ```bash
   npx tailwindcss init
   echo '@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;' > src/style.css
   ```

3. Ensure your build process integrates Tailwind CSS by including it in your build step. For example, in a PostCSS setup, your `postcss.config.js` might look like this:
   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     plugins: {
       tailwindcss: {},
       autoprefixer: {},
     }
   }
   ```

### Sample Tailwind CSS Classes for Features
Now, let's detail how you can use Tailwind's classes in your HTML to achieve the desired effects:

**1. Responsive Mobile-First Layout**:
   Utilize Tailwind's responsive utilities, applying styles that start with mobile and then scale up.
   ```html
   <div class="container mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
   ```

**2. Smooth Animations & Hover Effects**:
   Use Tailwind's transition utilities to add smooth transitions and hover effects.
   ```html
   <div class="transition ease-in-out hover:bg-gray-200">
   ```

**3. Lazy-loading for Images**:
   Use native HTML lazy loading with Tailwind for styling.
   ```html
   <img class="lazyload" data-src="image.jpg" alt="Description" loading="lazy">
   ```

**4. CTA Button with Hover Effect**:
   Style a call-to-action button with appropriate hover effect.
   ```html
   <button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
     Click me
   </button>
   ```

### Compiling Tailwind CSS
Finally, compile your CSS so that all the Tailwind utilities are applied correctly. Run the build process as configured, which might look like this:
```bash
npx tailwindcss -o dist/style.css
```

### Result
The final `style.css` will contain all the utility classes from Tailwind CSS, allowing you to use those classes directly in your HTML. It's important to note that with Tailwind CSS, direct manipulation of the `style.css` file is generally minimal; the bulk of your work will be applying the utility classes in HTML as shown above.
